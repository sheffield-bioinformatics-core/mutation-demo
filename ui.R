PARPi drug blocks an enzyme that is used to repair DNA damages. Cancer cells in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations have problems with fixing DNA breaks already and PARPi drug make that worse. As normal cells in BRCA1/2 carriers have one working copy of BRCA1/2 genes they remain. PARP inhibitor can then be used as a different therapeutic strategy for the treatment of tumors that lack BRCA function. Several PARPi have entered clinical trials and show promising activity in breast, ovarian and other cancers associated with BRCA1/2 mutations or other defects in DNA repair system (homologous recombination DNA repair).
